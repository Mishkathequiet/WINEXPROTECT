# Import for Windows 10 & 11
Use this manager for Windows Exploit Protection (now with GUI). Update every so often (this will not remove other entries & gets the most recent xml online every time) - that's it! Reboot to complete the import

### Backup, Remove & Import
To install some background services you'll need to temporarily remove protection which can be done as well; reboot & install software, update again or import any local XML. After restarting the device (again), these stricter policies help against intrusions like botnets & cache exploits

## Merged Repositories
- https://github.com/jdgregson/Exploit-Protection-Settings as to support Microsoft Office
- Added https://github.com/Strana-Mechty/ExploitProtection-Templates supporting Adobe, Telegram & more
- Calibrated with https://github.com/microsoft/ExploitProtectionConfiguration but all is already stricter

## Protection Links (!)

  - https://github.com/AndyFul/Hard_Configurator (further hardening of Windows)
