Windows 11 Exploit Protection Settings

After long days of tweaking somewhat desirable mitigation against memory space exploits of both standard Windows programs as well as a few specific ones, this is the relatively high security settings, still allowing for unique programs such as:

Music software:

- Audacity
- butt streaming
- Virtual DJ

Games:

- Steam & webhelper
- EasyAntiCheat
- GameOverlayUI
- Firestorm-Releasex64 Phoenix's viewer for Second Life (without internal java browser, slplugin or slvoice).

Video software:

- vMix64
- NDIRecord
- StreamDeck
- 

Common software:

- All (!) basic Microsoft Windows 11 services and programs all the way from start up! (took a few bluescreens for the team >.<).
- Intel chipset software
- AMD software
- NVIDIA driver
- Obsidian
- Google Chrome (may it be in a more secure form, still allowing extensions to run)
- Mozilla Firefox (very controlled and functional with exploit protection settings on)
- MS Edge & Internet Explorer (in case you click wrong)
- Excel
- OneDrive
- Outlook
- Word & Wordpad
- PowerPoint
- Visio
- Java
- MS Access
- dnscrypt-proxy
- Armcord (a Discord shelter)
- Acrobat framework
- VLC Media Player
- Windows Media Player
- 7z (unzip)
- VPN Unlimited
- Whatsapp

Please check your specific exploit protection settings for programs where some features might not work well, the only thing guaranteed is a boot. 
Will run 99% of all programs & features without the need to tweak.
